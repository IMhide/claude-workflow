            You are analyzing repository **${{ steps.parse-yaml.outputs.repository }}** to investigate and provide recommendations for specific performance issues reported in GitHub issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}.

            ## Step 1: Read the Performance Issue Report

            First, read the issue body from: ${{ github.event.issue.html_url }}

            The issue contains a detailed performance report with:
            - YAML frontmatter with repository information
            - Performance metrics (response times, throughput, error rates)
            - Critical information about the affected endpoint/action
            - Sample traces showing where time is spent
            - Possible N+1 query detection
            - Resource allocation breakdown

            **Parse the issue to extract**:
            - Affected endpoint/action name
            - Performance metrics (mean/median/p90/p95 response times)
            - Identified bottlenecks (e.g., database queries, external API calls)
            - Sample trace information
            - Any N+1 queries or resource allocation issues

            ## Step 2: Analyze the Repository

            Based on the specific issues identified in the report:

            ### 2.1 Locate the Problematic Code
            - Find the endpoint/action mentioned in the report
            - Locate controller/handler code for that specific endpoint
            - Identify database queries, API calls, or operations mentioned in the trace
            - Find related models, services, or helpers

            ### 2.2 Identify Root Causes
            Focus on the specific performance issues reported:
            - If N+1 queries are mentioned: Find the exact queries and relationships
            - If slow database queries: Analyze the specific query patterns
            - If external API calls are slow: Identify the integration points
            - If memory allocation is high: Find object creation patterns in that path
            - If long response times: Trace the execution path to find bottlenecks

            ### 2.3 Verify Against Samples
            Cross-reference the code with the sample traces in the issue:
            - Match method names and durations from samples to code
            - Verify which components are taking the most time
            - Identify if the issue is consistent across samples

            ## Step 3: Generate Targeted Recommendations

            Provide specific, actionable recommendations to fix the exact issues reported:

            ### Root Cause Summary
            - Clearly state what is causing the performance problem
            - Reference specific files, lines, and code patterns
            - Explain why this causes the performance degradation

            ### Recommended Fixes (Prioritized)

            For each issue identified in the report, provide:

            #### Fix #1: [Descriptive Title]
            **Problem**: Describe the specific issue (e.g., "N+1 query loading user associations")
            **Location**: `path/to/file.rb:123-145`
            **Current Impact**: [e.g., "Causing 50+ extra database queries per request"]

            **Recommended Solution**:
            Explain the fix approach (e.g., "Add eager loading with includes/preload")

            **Implementation**:
            ```language
            # CURRENT CODE (causing N+1)
            # Show the exact problematic code from the repository

            # RECOMMENDED FIX
            # Show the specific code change needed
            ```

            **Expected Improvement**: [e.g., "Reduce queries from 52 to 2, ~200ms faster"]
            **Effort**: [Low/Medium/High]

            #### Fix #2: [Next Most Important Fix]
            [Same structure as above]

            ### Additional Optimizations
            - Quick wins that complement the main fixes
            - Configuration changes (indexes, caching)
            - Monitoring recommendations

            ### Implementation Priority
            1. **Critical** - Fix immediately (highest impact on reported issue)
            2. **High** - Fix soon (addresses reported problem)
            3. **Medium** - Valuable improvements
            4. **Low** - Nice-to-have optimizations

            ### Testing Recommendations
            - How to verify the fixes work
            - Metrics to monitor before/after
            - Performance benchmarks to run

            ## Output Requirements

            - Be specific to the issues in the GitHub issue report
            - Reference exact files, line numbers, and code patterns found
            - Provide complete, copy-pasteable code fixes
            - Explain the reasoning behind each recommendation
            - Prioritize fixes by impact on the reported performance issue
            - Format as clear markdown suitable for a GitHub comment

            Start by reading the issue, then analyze the codebase for those specific problems.

          ### Troubleshooting

          Please verify:
          1. YAML frontmatter format is correct:
             ```yaml
             ---
             repository: owner/repo
             ---
             ```
          2. Repository exists and is accessible
          3. Repository contains analyzable code

          Check the workflow logs for detailed error information.
