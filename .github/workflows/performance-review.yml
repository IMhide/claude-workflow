            ## Analysis Tasks

            1. **Code Performance Analysis**
               - Identify performance bottlenecks in the code
               - Look for inefficient algorithms or data structures
               - Check for unnecessary computations or redundant operations
               - Review loop efficiency and potential optimizations

            2. **Memory & Resource Usage**
               - Identify potential memory leaks
               - Check for proper resource cleanup (file handles, connections, etc.)
               - Review object allocation patterns
               - Look for opportunities to reduce memory footprint

            3. **Database & I/O Operations**
               - Review database queries for N+1 problems
               - Check for missing indexes or inefficient queries
               - Identify unnecessary I/O operations
               - Review caching strategies and opportunities

            4. **Async & Concurrency**
               - Check for blocking operations that could be async
               - Review thread safety and race conditions
               - Identify parallelization opportunities
               - Check for deadlock potential

            5. **Frontend Performance** (if applicable)
               - Review bundle size and code splitting
               - Check for render performance issues
               - Identify unnecessary re-renders
               - Review asset optimization

            6. **API & Network**
               - Check for inefficient API calls
               - Review payload sizes
               - Identify opportunities for batching or caching

            ## Output Format

            Please provide your findings in a structured report with:
            - **Executive Summary**: High-level overview of performance health
            - **Critical Issues**: Problems that need immediate attention
            - **Recommendations**: Prioritized list of improvements with estimated impact
            - **Quick Wins**: Easy fixes with good performance gains
            - **Code Examples**: Specific before/after code suggestions where applicable

            Create a GitHub issue with your complete performance review report.
